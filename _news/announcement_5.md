I’m thrilled to see our publication on ACL 2024 “Learn from failure: Fine-tuning LLMs with Trial-and-Error Data for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic Proving” is featured by Neptunes News Agency!

In this interview, I had the chance to reflect on our work, and share insights about the utility of trial-and-error information in training SOTA large language models like Llama 3. 

A big thank you to the Neptune team for the opportunity and for shedding light on this work! Please check out the link!
