I'm thrilled to share that our paper, "Learn from Failure: Fine-Tuning LLMs with Trial-and-Error Data for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic Proving", has been accepted to the main conference at Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) 2024! This work studies the usefulness of the trial-and-error information by fine-tuning the LLMs with it in order to help the models perform reasoning in logic deduction problems.
