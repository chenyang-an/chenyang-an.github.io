I am a 4-th Ph.D. student in the Mathematics Department, UC San Diego, where I am advised by Prof. Jonathan Novak(https://jinovak.com).
Prior to UCSD, I completed my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and B.A. in Economics at UC San Diego.

My research is grounded in Machine Learning and Large Language Model (LLM) for Reasoning, with an emphasis on Automatic Theorem Proving. 
Specifically, I use deep learning methods to prove mathematical theorems in formalized envrionments.

I also work on Weingarten functions of groups with their applications in mathematica physics.


* LLMs for Automatic Theorem Proving
* Weingarten functions of groups
