I am a 4-th year Ph.D. student in the Mathematics Department, UC San Diego, where I am advised by Prof. Jonathan Novak.
Prior to UCSD, I completed my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and B.A. in Economics at UC San Diego.

As a math Ph.D. student, my research focuses extensively on 2D Quantum Gravity and mathematical physics. I study the intersection number
of moduli space of curves as orbifolds. This field exhibits a profound connection between algebraic geometry and physics. 

I'm also interested 
in Machine Learning and Large Language Model (LLM) for Mathematical Reasoning, with an emphasis on Automated Theorem Proving. 
Specifically, I use deep learning methods to prove mathematical theorems in formalized envrionments.

If you are interested in any of the topics above, feel free to drop me an email!
