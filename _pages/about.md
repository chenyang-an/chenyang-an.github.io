I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon AWS Automated Reasoning Group, working on LLM post-training, reasoning and verification.

I interned at Microsoft Research in Seattle during the summer of 2024, focusing on improving the training efficiency of large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks. I also worked part-time at Scale AI as an AI Consultant, contributing to the development of LLM-based web agents and scalable verification systems for reasoning data. In Spring 2025, I joined Amazon AWS Neurosymbolic as an Applied Scientist Intern, where I designed a new reinforcement learning pipeline incorporating a diversity-based reward to encourage the generation of varied chains of thought (CoTs), along with the supporting data preprocessing framework.
