I am a 5-th year Ph.D. student in the Mathematics Department, UC San Diego, where I am advised by Prof. Sam Buss and co-advised by Prof. Jingbo Shang.
Prior to my Ph.D. study, I completed my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and B.A. in Economics at UC San Diego.

My current research focuses on Large Language Model (LLM) Reasoning and in natural language and formalized environments, and LLM post-training using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

My prior research focused on 2D Quantum Gravity and mathematical physics, studying the interplay between algebra, geometry and physics. 

I interned at Microsoft Research in Seattle during the summer of 2024, focusing on improving the training efficiency of large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks. I also worked part-time at Scale AI as an AI Consultant, contributing to the development of LLM-based web agents and scalable verification systems for reasoning data. In Spring 2025, I joined Amazon AWS Neurosymbolic as an Applied Scientist Intern, where I designed a new reinforcement learning pipeline incorporating a diversity-based reward to encourage the generation of varied chains of thought (CoTs), along with the supporting data preprocessing framework.

If you are interested in any of the topics above, feel free to drop me an email!
